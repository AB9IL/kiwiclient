# KiwiClient

This is a Python client for KiwiSDR. This allows you to:

* Receive the sample stream
* Issue commands to the SDR
* Be awesome!

And in general much more useful than keeping your browser open and meddling with all that virtual audio cables stuff.

## Demo code

The following demo programs are provided to you to play with:

* `kiwirecorder`: record audio to WAV files, with squelch
* `kiwifax`: decode radiofax and save as PNGs, with auto start, stop, and phasing
